## My process

- Set up the html elements

- Set up the variables for certain colors and sizes that are found from the designs.
- Style the mobile version
- Style the desktop version

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- sass partials,variables and nesting
- Correct class and id naming!

### What I learned

- Think i need to change the file and folder names to stop using camelcase and use hyphens like class names!

### Continued development

- Continue hyphen-delimited with class and id names.
- Change names of file and folders to all lowercase and hyphen delimited naming
